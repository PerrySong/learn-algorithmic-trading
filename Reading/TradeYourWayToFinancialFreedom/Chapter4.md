# Chapter 4: Steps to Developing a System

## Take an Inventory    
## Develop an Open Mind and Gather Market Information    
## Determine Your Mission and Your Objectives    
## Determine the Concept That You Want to Trade 

1. Trend Following: 
However, all trend followers must ask themselves the following questions:   
• How will I spot my trends? How will I know a market is trending?   
• Will I be trading trends on the upside and the downside?   
• What will I do when the market goes sideways (which tends to be about 85 percent of the time, according to many estimates)?    
• What will my entry criteria be?   
• How will I handle corrections?   
• How will I know when the trend is over?   

2. Band Trading:   

• How do I find range-bound markets to buy?   
  
• Will my bands work in a trending market?   
• How do I define the range? For example, should I use fixed or static bands?    
• What are my entry criteria?   
• What if my band breaks down? How will I exit?   
• Do I exit at the other end of the band and under what criteria?   

3. Value Trading:  

Value trading centers on some definition of value. You buy stocks or commodities that are undervalued and sell them when they are overvalued. When you adopt this approach, the key questions you must ask yourself are the following:

• How do I define value?      
• When is something undervalued?      
• What are my criteria for buying something that is undervalued?     
• What are my criteria for selling something that is overvalued?    

4. Arbitrage:  

Arbitrage occurs when you are able to buy something at a low price in one place and sell it for a higher price in some other place.

• What areas of the market do I need to search to find loopholes?
• What exactly is the loophole, and how can I best take advantage of it? • What are the risks?
• How long will the loophole last, and how will I know it’s over?

5. Spreading as a Concept:   

Another technique used by market makers and options traders is spreading. Spreading is somewhat related to arbitrage in that it requires that you usually buy one thing and sell something else, hoping you have the relationship right. For example, most trading of foreign currency is a form of spreading because you become long (that is, you own it and profit if it goes up) in one currency against another (that is, you profit if it goes down).   

• What do I think might move?   
• What can I short against that move to hedge my risk?   
• Is there a limit to my profit (as there is with some options spreads)?   
• How will I know if I’m wrong?   
• Or if I’m right, how will I know the move is over?   



## Determine the Big Picture     
As a result, I now think it’s critical to make part of your system development an assessment of the big picture. Several noncorrelated systems that fit the big picture would make up a great trading business plan. In addition, you might develop several more systems to use should the big picture change. 

## Determine Your Time Frame for Trading   

### Long term investing:   

Pros: 
1. No need to watch the market all day, you can use stops or options to protect yourself.  
2. Psychological pressure of the market is lowest in this type of system.  
3. Transaction costs are low.  
4. It only takes one or two trades to make your whole year profitable.  
5. You could have an expectancy (see Chapter 7) well over a dollar per dollar risked.  
6. You can use a simple methodology to make a lot of money.  
7. You theoretically have an infinite profit opportunity with each trade or investment.  
8. Costs of data and equipment are minimal.  

Cons: 
1. You can be by intraday market moves each day.   
2. You can have large equity swings on a single position.  
3. You must be patient.  
4. It usually has a reliability (number of winning trades) of less than 50 percent.  
5. Trades tend to be infrequent, so you must capitalize by trading many markets.   
6. It requires a lot of money to participate if you want to trade big liquid futures markets.   
7. If you miss one good trading opportunity, it can turn a winning year into a losing year.  

### Short term trading: 

Pros:   
1. Most day traders get many opportunities each day.   
2. This type of trading is very exciting and stimulating.   
3. If you have a methodology with an expectancy of 50 cents or more per dollar risked, you may never have a losing month - or even week.   
4. You don't have overnight risk in day trading, so there is little or no margin required even in big markets.   
5. High-probability entry systems, which most people want, work with short-term trading.   
6. There's always another opportunity to make money.   
7. Transaction costs have come down so significantly that they are no longer prohibitive.   

Cons:   
1. Transaction costs are still high and can add up. For example, in my own active account, transaction costs for last year amounted to about 20 percent of the initial value of the account.   
2. Excitement usually has nothing to do with making money - it;s a psychological need!   
3. Profits are limited by time, so you may need to have a reliability well over 50 percent to make money. However, I've seen some notable exceptions to this rule of thumb.   
4. Data osts are very high because most short-term raders need live quotes.   
5. Many high-probability entries can habe losses that are bigger than the gains.   
6. Short-term systems are subject to the random noise of the markets.   
7. The short-term psychological pressures are intense.   

## Determine the Essence of Your Trading and How You Can Objectively Measure It   


## Determine What Your Initial 1R Risk Will Be   
## Add Your Profit-Taking Exits and Determine the R-Multiple Distribution of Your System and Its Expectancy   
## Determine the Accuracy of Your R-Multiple Distribution   
## Evaluate Your Overall System   
## Use Position Sizing to Meet Your Objectives  
##  Determine How You Can Improve Your System   

## Mentally Plan for Your Worst-Case Scenario  

## Summary   
1. There is a lot more to modeling excellence than just finding out what the key tasks are. You need to find the components of each task, and you need to be able to install the model in other people. We’ve been able to accomplish this with the system development model. However, the topic of model development would be an entire book by itself.   

2. The references to all of these books are given in the Recommended Readings at the end of the book.   

3. Chande’s book is very good, but I don’t agree with all his conclusions, especially when he starts testing portfolios and developing conclusions about position sizing.    

4. These people may have purchased a dozen low-capitalization stocks. Eleven may turn out to be worthless, while one turns into a new giant. Because the stocks were largely ignored, the owner neither gets rid of the losers before they become worthless nor finds out about the winner until it is worth a lot of money.   

5. Somehow fate is often cruel to people with such a great system. In this person’s case, he could not trade size. Nor was it possible for him to fix his problem psychologically because he did not believe that he had anything to do with the problem. In fact, at this point he cannot trade at all because he’s nervous and he believes that his stomach is stopping him from trading. Thus, in my opinion, he doesn’t understand the real meaning behind a Holy Grail system—finding yourself in the market.    

6. One of my clients has developed a day-trading system based on gains being significantly larger than losses. His system has a reliability rate of less than 50 percent, yet it nets him tremendous rates of return. This shows that there are other ways to conceive of short-term systems.   

7. The word stop is used here because most people execute such stops by putting in a stop order in the market. This means “Execute my order as a market order once it reaches that price.”   

8. If you are looking at your expectancy based on the results of real trading (that is, what you have been doing in the market), then a low expectancy (15 cents per dollar risked or less) could be due to psychological problems such as not following your system or panicking and taking profits too early.
