# Chapter 4: Steps to Developing a System

## Take an Inventory    
## Develop an Open Mind and Gather Market Information    
## Determine Your Mission and Your Objectives    
## Determine the Concept That You Want to Trade 

1. Trend Following: 
However, all trend followers must ask themselves the following questions:   
• How will I spot my trends? How will I know a market is trending?   
• Will I be trading trends on the upside and the downside?   
• What will I do when the market goes sideways (which tends to be about 85 percent of the time, according to many estimates)?    
• What will my entry criteria be?   
• How will I handle corrections?   
• How will I know when the trend is over?   

2. Band Trading:   

• How do I find range-bound markets to buy?   
  
• Will my bands work in a trending market?   
• How do I define the range? For example, should I use fixed or static bands?    
• What are my entry criteria?   
• What if my band breaks down? How will I exit?   
• Do I exit at the other end of the band and under what criteria?   

3. Value Trading:  

Value trading centers on some definition of value. You buy stocks or commodities that are undervalued and sell them when they are overvalued. When you adopt this approach, the key questions you must ask yourself are the following:

• How do I define value?      
• When is something undervalued?      
• What are my criteria for buying something that is undervalued?     
• What are my criteria for selling something that is overvalued?    

4. Arbitrage:  

Arbitrage occurs when you are able to buy something at a low price in one place and sell it for a higher price in some other place.

• What areas of the market do I need to search to find loopholes?
• What exactly is the loophole, and how can I best take advantage of it? • What are the risks?
• How long will the loophole last, and how will I know it’s over?

5. Spreading as a Concept:   

Another technique used by market makers and options traders is spreading. Spreading is somewhat related to arbitrage in that it requires that you usually buy one thing and sell something else, hoping you have the relationship right. For example, most trading of foreign currency is a form of spreading because you become long (that is, you own it and profit if it goes up) in one currency against another (that is, you profit if it goes down).   

• What do I think might move?   
• What can I short against that move to hedge my risk?   
• Is there a limit to my profit (as there is with some options spreads)?   
• How will I know if I’m wrong?   
• Or if I’m right, how will I know the move is over?   



## Determine the Big Picture     
As a result, I now think it’s critical to make part of your system development an assessment of the big picture. Several noncorrelated systems that fit the big picture would make up a great trading business plan. In addition, you might develop several more systems to use should the big picture change. 

## Determine Your Time Frame for Trading   

### Long term investing:   

Pros: 
1. No need to watch the market all day, you can use stops or options to protect yourself.  
2. Psychological pressure of the market is lowest in this type of system.  
3. Transaction costs are low.  
4. It only takes one or two trades to make your whole year profitable.  
5. You could have an expectancy (see Chapter 7) well over a dollar per dollar risked.  
6. You can use a simple methodology to make a lot of money.  
7. You theoretically have an infinite profit opportunity with each trade or investment.  
8. Costs of data and equipment are minimal.  

Cons: 
1. You can be by intraday market moves each day.   
2. You can have large equity swings on a single position.  
3. You must be patient.  
4. It usually has a reliability (number of winning trades) of less than 50 percent.  
5. Trades tend to be infrequent, so you must capitalize by trading many markets.   
6. It requires a lot of money to participate if you want to trade big liquid futures markets.   
7. If you miss one good trading opportunity, it can turn a winning year into a losing year.  

### Short term trading: 

Pros:   
1. Most day traders get many opportunities each day.   
2. This type of trading is very exciting and stimulating.   
3. If you have a methodology with an expectancy of 50 cents or more per dollar risked, you may never have a losing month - or even week.   
4. You don't have overnight risk in day trading, so there is little or no margin required even in big markets.   
5. High-probability entry systems, which most people want, work with short-term trading.   
6. There's always another opportunity to make money.   
7. Transaction costs have come down so significantly that they are no longer prohibitive.   

Cons:   
1. Transaction costs are still high and can add up. For example, in my own active account, transaction costs for last year amounted to about 20 percent of the initial value of the account.   
2. Excitement usually has nothing to do with making money - it;s a psychological need!   
3. Profits are limited by time, so you may need to have a reliability well over 50 percent to make money. However, I've seen some notable exceptions to this rule of thumb.   
4. Data osts are very high because most short-term raders need live quotes.   
5. Many high-probability entries can habe losses that are bigger than the gains.   
6. Short-term systems are subject to the random noise of the markets.   
7. The short-term psychological pressures are intense.

10. Determine the Accuracy of Your R-Multiple Distribution   
11. Evaluate Your Overall System   
12. Use Position Sizing to Meet Your Objectives   
13. Determine How You Can Improve Your System   
14. Mentally Plan for Your Worst-Case Scenario
