# Chapter8: Using Setups to Jumpstart Your System

## 5 Phases of Entry

1. Appropriate Conditions for Your System (bear secular? Bull secular?)
2. Market Selection:
* Liquidity

* Newness of the Market: Generally, it’s best to avoid new markets—whether it’s newly created futures contracts or stocks that have just been introduced onto the exchange. Some people specialize in new issues, called initial public offerings, or IPOs. Certainly, in strong bull markets, new stock issues often tend to go up rapidly. They also collapse rapidly. Perhaps your “edge” might be that you keep on top of enough information about new companies that you feel safe investing in them. However, just remember that this is a dangerous area for amateurs.

* What Exchange Makes a Market for the Underlying Investment, and Do You Know Its Rules of Trading?

* Volatility Volatility: Day traders, for example, need to trade highly volatile markets. Since they are typically out of a position at the end of the day, they need to trade markets that have enough daily volatility to allow for large profits. Usually, only certain currency markets, the stock indexes, highly liquid stocks, and the bond markets qualify as good markets for day traders.

* How Well Does That Market Follow Your Trading Concept?

* Select a Portfolio of Independent Markets
