# SUMMARY
The amount of information to which the average individual is now exposed doubles every year. Consciously, however, we can only process about 7 chunks of information before it is lost. As a result, we have developed a number of shortcuts or heuristics to help us cope with the vast amount of information to which we are exposed. These heuristics are useful under most circumstances, but their implications for traders and investors are so strong that my belief is that the average person has no probability of making money in the markets unless he or she deals with them. I’ve divided these heuristics into three types of biases that are summarized below.

## Biases That Affect Trading System Development
### Representation bias
People assume that when something is supposed to represent something, that it really is what it is supposed to represent. Thus, we assume that the daily bar chart is the market or that our favorite indicator is the market. Instead, we need to keep in mind that the representation is just a shortcut for presenting a lot of information, or even worse, a distortion of that information.

### Reliability bias
People assume that something is accurate when it may not be. For example, market data that you use in your historical testing or that come to you live are often filled with errors. Unless you assume that errors can and do exist, you may make lots of mistakes in your trading and investing decisions.

### Lotto bias
People want to control the market, and so they tend to focus on entry, where they can “force” the market to do a lot of things before they enter. Unfortunately, once they enter, the market is going to do what the market is going to do. And the golden rule of trading “Cut your losses short and let your profits run” has nothing to do with entry and everything to do with exits.

### Law-of-small-numbers bias
People tend to see patterns where none exist, and it takes only a few well-chosen examples to convince someone that a pattern has meaning. When you combine this bias with the conservatism bias (below), you have a very dangerous situation.
Conservatism bias.
Once you believe you have found such a pattern and become convinced that it works (by means of a few well-chosen examples), you will do everything you can to avoid evidence that it does not work.

### Randomness bias
People like to assume that the market is random and has many tops and bottoms that they can trade easily. Yet the markets are not random. Distributions of prices show that markets over time have infinite variance, or what statisticians call “long tails” at the end of the bell curve. Furthermore, people fail to understand that even random markets can have long streaks. As a result, top and bottom fishing is the most difficult type of trading there is.

### Need-to-understand bias
We attempt to make order out of the market and find reasons for everything. This attempt to find order tends to block our ability to go with the flow of the markets because we see what we expect to see rather than what is really happening.
Biases That Affect How You Test Trading Systems

### Degrees-of-freedom bias
We want to optimize our systems, and we believe that the more we manipulate the data to fit history, the more we know about trading well. Instead, you are much better off understanding how your concept (that you are using to trade or invest) works and doing only a minimum amount of historical testing.

### Postdictive error bias
We can inadvertently use data in system development that, in real-life trading, will not yet have occurred. For example, if you factor today’s close into your analysis, then you will probably do very well in your testing—especially when you tend to exit before the close.

### Not-giving-yourself-enough-protection bias
People fail to consider that position sizing and exit strategies are a key part of trading. Consequently, they often put too much of their capital at risk in a given trade.
Biases That Affect How You Trade Your System

### Gambler’s fallacy bias
People assume that the probability goes up for a win after a long losing streak or up for a loss after a long winning streak.

### Conservative-with-profits-and-risky-with-losses bias
People want to take profits quickly and give their losses some room. This gives them the illusion of being right, but what they are really doing is cutting their profits short and letting their losses run.

### My-current-trade-or-investment-must-be-a-winner bias
This bias may be at the root of all other biases. Yet being right has little to do with making money.
