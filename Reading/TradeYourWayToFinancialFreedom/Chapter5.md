## Value Trading

* Extreme discount stock usually occurs in the end of a bear market.   
* Never buy an undervalued stock when it is going down. Instead, let the stock prove itself. Get some indication from the market that the downtrend is over.At minimum, I want my stock to have formed at least a two-month base, meaning that it has stayed in the same price range for two months. Even better, I’d prefer a stock to be going up for at least two months before I buy it. 

## Band Trading   
Band trading can be the foundation of your trading toolbox or a useful complement to other strategies. To wrap up this section, let’s look at the pros and cons of band trading.

### Pros:
Band trading is effective in many more market conditions than trend-following strategies. It works in up, down, and sideways markets as long as there is enough volatility to produce a usable band. This, along with more frequent opportunities to trade, allows a successful band trader to produce a smoother, less volatile equity curve than a trend follower. Therefore, band traders can often use more aggressive position-sizing strategies and have a lower account equity requirement to successfully implement their strategy.

### Cons:   
Band trading requires entries that are countertrend in nature. You sell after a move up and buy after a move down. This is very difficult for many trend followers. There are some stocks and commodities that do not trend very well and make poor trend-following candidates. Likewise, there are those that have ranges that are too tight for band trading or do not trade well in ranges (they frequently extend far past bands, for example). These can be identified only through experience and/or backtesting.   

### Editor's Comments:   
Band trading typically gives you lots of trading opportunities, and it is excellent for short-term traders. Thus, if you like (1) lots of trading activity, (2) selling highs, and (3) buying lows, then some form of band trading might be right for you.
If you look at the charts, you’ll see many examples that work very well and many examples that do not work at all. Your job as a band trader would be to (1) maximize the good trades and (2) minimize the losing trades by either filtering them out or reducing their impact through your exits. But those are topics for later in this book because they are important for any system you might develop.

## Seasonal Tendencies

## Spread Trading   

All the previous concepts can be used with spreading. The advantage of spreading is simply that you can trade a relationship that was not tradable before. When you buy gold, for example, you are really buying the relationship between gold and your currency. The relationship will go up if either your currency goes down in value with respect to gold or gold goes up in value with respect to your currency. For example, in 2003 we seemed to have a rise in the price of gold. However, gold went up in 2003 only because the U.S. dollar went down and we were looking at gold prices in U.S. dollars. In contrast, the gold move in 2006 was in all currencies. Gold is actually going up while the dollar is going up.
A spread simply sets up another relationship that you can trade. It could be a stock priced in dollars or euros, or even the relationship between gold and oil prices.

## THERE’S AN ORDER TO THE UNIVERSE

## SUMMARY
The purpose of this chapter was to introduce you to a few of the many different concepts that you can use to trade or invest in the market, depending on your beliefs. Each of these concepts could give you an edge, but none of these concepts will help you make money unless they are combined with all of the other significant factors that are contained within this book, such as having an initial stop, having exits, understanding your system as a distribution of R multiples, or using position sizing to meet your objectives. All of these topics will be covered later in this book and must be integrated with whatever concepts you elect to trade as your primary “style” of investing.
None of these concepts, in my opinion, is more valid (or valuable) than any other. In addition, I’m not expressing any personal preferences for any of these
concepts. My point in including this chapter is simply to show you how many different ideas there are. 

1. Tom Basso started out with the discussions by talking about trend following, and he simply expressed the viewpoint that the markets occasionally move in one direction for a long time or trend. These trends can be captured and form the basis for a type of trading. The basic philosophy is to find a criterion to determine when the market is trending, enter the market in the direction of the trend, and then exit when the trend is over or the signal proves to be false. It’s an easy technique to follow, and it makes good money if you understand the concepts behind it and follow it consistently.   

2. Chuck LeBeau discussed the next concept, fundamental analysis. This is the actual analysis of supply and demand in the market, and many academics think it is the only way one can trade. The concept typically does give you a price objective, but your analysis (or some expert’s analysis) may have no relationship to what prices actually do. Nevertheless, some people trade fundamental data quite well, and this is another option for you to consider. Chuck gives seven suggestions for you to follow if you wish to follow this concept. Generally, a trend supported by fundamentals is much stronger than a trend with no fundamental reason behind it. Mostly, Chuck discusses fundamental analysis only as it applies to the futures markets, not as it applies to equities. That is covered in the value section.   

3. Next I covered the idea of value investing in which you buy what you believe to be undervalued and sell what you believe to be overvalued. It’s a simple concept used by many people who are considered market geniuses. However, the key question is, “How do you determine value?” This section discusses the methods that work and the methods that do not work and also offers some tips to improve your performance if you like value investing.   

4. D. R. Barton covered band trading. If you believe that a market tends to be range bound and that the range is wide enough to trade, then band trading offers you the perfect solutions. This concept works well for short-term traders and for people who dislike buying high and selling low. D.R. discusses the advantages and disadvantages of band trading as well as providing a brief description of the types of bands traded.

5. Jerry Toepke discussed the concept of seasonal tendencies. Seasonal analysis is based on the fundamental qualities of certain products to be
different ideas there are.

higher priced at some times during the year and lower priced at other times. The result is a concept that combines both the supply-and-demand analysis of fundamental analysis and the timing value of trend following. It’s another way to play the markets if you ensure that there is a valid reason for any seasonal tendencies that you find.   

6. Kevin Thomas, a former floor trader on the LIFFE exchange, talked about spreading. The advantage of spreading is that you are trading relationships between products instead of the products themselves. As a result, new opportunities are available that could not come to you any other way. Kevin gives some wonderful examples of spreads in his discussion.


7. Arbitrage, presented by Ray Kelly in a very humorous and artful way, is looking for opportunities that have a very narrow window of opportunity. While the window is open, the opportunity is like “free money.” However, sooner or later the window shuts, and then the arb player must find new opportunities. Ray gives many examples of such windows and gives some humorous stories of his frustrations in trying to capture some of them.   

8. Lou Mendelsohn covered the topic of intermarket analysis, the idea that one market might be influenced by many other markets. If you can begin to understand how those markets are related, then you may have an edge in understanding price changes in the market in which you are interested in trading.   

9. The final concept presented was a synopsis of several theories that claim to understand some magic order to the markets. There are three types of order concepts: (1) based on waves of human emotion, (2) based on large physical events influencing human behavior, and (3) based on mathematical order. Many of them may have little or no validity, but people trade them because they believe they work. Furthermore, if enough people believe something will work, then the concept becomes “real” and does work. As a result, these concepts can be traded profitably—just as random entry can be traded profitably, as you’ll learn in the entry chapter. In this last discussion, you learned how to take one of the order concepts (if one of them appeals to you) and use it to your advantage. Such concepts are probably excellent for people who feel that they must know how markets work before they can commit themselves to trade.
