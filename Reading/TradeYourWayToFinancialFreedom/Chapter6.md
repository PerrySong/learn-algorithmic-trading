## FACTOR 1. THE U.S. DEBT SITUATION   

### Personal assessment:   

• Do you believe that government, business, and consumers in the United States can continue to spend at current rates without serious consequences?
• Or even if we stopped deficit spending right now, do you believe that we can get out of the current massive debt without serious economic consequences?
• If your answer to the first two questions is no, then what do you think the economic consequences will be? Your answer should be part of the planning you do with respect to the big picture.
• If your answer to the first two questions is yes, then how do you deal with the fact that our gross federal interest payments are now 14 percent of the government’s expenses (although they cheat on this and credit about half of it to social security)? If the deficit keeps growing, what will happen?

## FACTOR 2. THE SECULAR BEAR MARKET

### Personal assessment:   

* Do you believe that stock P/E ratios go through cycles?
• Do you believe that during high P/E levels (over 19 percent), long-term returns from the stock market could easily be zero?
• Do you believe that P/E ratios are likely to fall when inflation heats up or deflation enters the picture?
• Do you believe that this pertains to your investing system? In my opinion, the shorter your time frame, the less it pertains to you. However, it would be a mistake to say “I’m a day trader and this doesn’t pertain to me” because most day traders could not make it as stock market volatility
 
disappeared during the initial phases of this secular bear market. Generally, as the market goes down, interest in the stock market disappears and market volatility drops.


## FACTOR 3. THE GLOBALIZATION OF ECONOMIC FACTORS   

### Personal assessment:   

• What has my base currency done (relative to other currencies) during the time period I’m considering?
• What has inflation done to the value of my base currency?
• Are my returns reasonable when compared with other markets worldwide in which I could have invested during the same time period?
• How is the global economy moving during this time period, and what is the impact that it will have on my investment strategy?
• For example, what if commodities continue to escalate at 30 percent per year?
• What happens if the economy of the country in which I largely invest (for example, the United States) shrinks relative to the economy of other nations in the world?
• What happens if Bretton Woods II disappears and other countries stop supporting the U.S. debt and the U.S. dollar?

## FACTOR 4. THE IMPACT OF MUTUAL FUNDS

### Personal assessment:   
* What markets will I be trading, and who trades most of the money in these markets?   
• What is the system by which the big players operate in my market? Is there some way that their system could totally break down? How and under what condition is it likely to occur?   
• How can I monitor what the big traders are doing?   
• How will “what the big traders are doing” affect my strategy and my performance?   

## FACTOR 5. CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND TAXES

## FACTOR 6. HUMAN BEINGS’ TENDENCY TO PLAY A LOSING ECONOMIC GAME

## OTHER AREAS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER

## HOW WILL YOU MONITOR THE BIG PICTURE?

## Summary: 

* A sample view of the factors affecting the major markets of the world was discussed based on my beliefs:
* U.S. debt
* The secular bear market in the United States
* The emergence of countries like China and India with the impact of their consumption patterns on the world’s raw materials
* The current mutual fund structure and the problems that will happen when the baby boomers retire
* The impact of rules, regulations, and new laws, especially tax laws • The fact that most human beings play a losing economic game
* Plus other potential major factors
