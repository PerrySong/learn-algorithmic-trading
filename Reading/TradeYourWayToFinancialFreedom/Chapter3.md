# 3: Setting Your Objectives

## Part 1. Self-Assessment

### How much time during the day do you have to devote to trading?   
[This is important because the amount of time you have available almost dictates the kind of trading system you must develop. Those who have a full-time job and just look at the markets in the evening must, quite obviously, find a fairly long-term system to use.]

### When you are trading, how many distractions can you expect to have?   

### How much time do you expect to devote to developing your trading system, to doing your personal psychological work, and to working on your business plan for trading?   

### What are your computer skills? What skills do you need before you begin this trading venture?  

### What do you know about statistics?   
### How would you rate your market knowledge? [Here you should include knowledge of trading mechanics, what moves the markets, how to execute orders effectively at low cost, any trading indicators you might need, and so on.]  

### What are your psychological strengths and weaknesses, especially in terms of trading system development?    
### How about your strengths and weaknesses in terms of personal discipline?   

### Do you tend to get compulsive (that is, do you get caught up in the excitement of trading), do you have personal conflicts (that is, do you have a history of conflicts in your family life, at your job, or during past trading experience), or do you have any emotional issues that constantly crop up, such as fear or anger?   

### Based on your personal inventory, what do you need to learn, accomplish, or solve prior to beginning trading? How will you do that?   

## Part 2: Defining Your Objective   

### What is your advantage or edge in trading? What is the particular concept that you are trading that gives you an advantage?

TBD

### How much money do you have personally? How much of that money could you afford to lose? For example, most funds stop trading at 50 percent. How about you? How much risk can you afford to take on a given trade?

TBD

### I know this doesn’t pertain to you, but I’ll ask anyway because it’s one of the standard questions under objectives. Are you being realistic, or are you expecting to trade like the best trader in the world? For example, suppose you have a very good system that is right half the time and gives you profits that are twice as large as your losses. In that system, just by chance, you could still easily have 10 losses in a row. Your system is still working as expected, but you could easily have 10 losses in a row. Could you tolerate that?   

TBD

### Do you have the time to trade short term?    

TBD

### How much social contact do you need?    

TBD

### Can you work by yourself day after day? Do you need one or two other people around, or do you need a lot of other people around? How much do those other people influence you?   

TBD  

### In summary, what do you expect to make each year as a percentage of your trading capital?   

About 20 to 40 percent.

### What risk level are you willing to tolerate in order to achieve that?   

About half the potential gain, so the maximum loss would be 20 percent in a year.   

### What is the largest peak-to-trough drawdown you are willing to tolerate?   

About 25 percent.   

### How will you know your plan is working, and how will you know when it’s not working? What do you expect from your system in various kinds of markets? Trending? Consolidating? Highly volatile?    

TBD

## Part 3. Trading Ideas   

### Tom, what kind of markets do you want to trade? Is it appropriate to specialize? Do you want to trade only liquid markets, or are there some illiquid markets you’d like to trade?   

TBD

### What beliefs do you have about entering the markets? How important do you believe entry to be?   

TBD

### Given your goals in terms of returns and drawdowns, what kind of initial risk stop do you want? If it’s close, will you be able to get right back into the market so that you will not miss a move?

TBD

### How do you plan to take profits? Reversal stops? Trailing stops? Technical stops? Price objectives? Contrary to popular opinion, much of your emphasis should be in the area of stops and exits.   

TBD

### What do you do in terms of position sizing?    

## Objectives for Individuals
## What is your advantage or edge in trading? What is the particular concept that you are trading that gives you an advantage? [If you don’t know, various concepts are discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Think about the issues and then answer the question.]   

### How much money do you have personally? How much of that money could you afford to lose? For example, most funds stop trading at 50 percent. How about you? How much risk can you afford to take on a given trade?   

### How much money do you need to make each year? Do you need to live off that money?   

### What if you don’t make enough to live off it? Can you make more than you need to live off of so that your trading capital can grow? Can you stand regular withdrawals from your trading capital to pay your monthly bills?   

### Are you being realistic, or are you expecting to trade like the best trader in the world? For example, suppose you have a very good system that is right half the time and gives you profits that are twice as large as your losses. In that system, just by chance, you could still easily have 10 losses in a row. Your system is still working as expected, but you could easily have 10 losses in a row. Could you tolerate that?

## Part 3. Trading Ideas
The last section gets specifically into how you want to trade. It has to do with ideas about markets, entry, exit, and money management—the specifics of your trading plan.

### What kind of markets do you want to trade? Is it appropriate to specialize? Do you want to trade only liquid markets, or are there some illiquid markets you’d like to trade?   

### Do you want any conditions to set up before you enter the market? If so, what are those conditions? [Tom did not answer this question, but you might find it useful to answer it.]   

### What beliefs do you have about entering the markets? How important do you believe entry to be?   

### Given your goals in terms of returns and drawdowns, what kind of initial risk stop do you want? If it’s close, will you be able to get right back into the market so that you will not miss a move? [In other words,discuss what kind of stop loss you plan to have.]   


### How do you plan to take profits? Reversal stops? Trailing stops? Technical stops? Price objectives? Contrary to popular opinion, much of your emphasis should be in the area of stops and exits.   

### What do you do in terms of position sizing? [Write down any specific ideas you may have here.]
