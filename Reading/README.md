# Book list:
Suggestion from the Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management author:

When your mind is open,start reading about the markets. I strongly recommend almost any book written by Jack Schwager. However, start with Market Wizards and The New Market Wizards. They are two of the best books available on trading and investing. Two other books by Schwager, Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis, are also excellent.

Computer Analysis of the Futures Market, by Charles LeBeau and David Lucas, is one of the best books available on the systematic process of developing a trading system. Indeed, I’ve learned a lot from reading that book and from conducting regular workshops with Chuck. I’d also recommend Perry Kaufman’s book Smarter Trading; Cynthia Kase’s book Trading with the Odds; and William O’Neil’s book How to Make Money in Stocks. Tushar Chande’s book Beyond Technical Analysis3 is also good in that it gets the reader to think about concepts that are beyond the scope of this volume.
