# Applying Quantitative Approach to Value Investing

* Value investing is an investment pilosophy which selects udervalued stocks (market value less than intrinsic value), despite sound finacial and operational metrics. Value investors perform rigours analysis of the fundamentals and try to buy the stock at a discount compared to the intrinsic value calculated.

* Value investing is all about paying less than the security's value. Profit is realized when the price reverts to the value it deserves.

* Value investors consider price and value to be distinct. In the words of Warren Buffett "price is what you pay; value is waht you get."

* Quantitative approach affords investors with the possibility of analysing vast number of stocks by harnessing computational power.

* There are many quantitative methods of value investing. We will discuss Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula and Piotroski F-Score in this course since their effectiveness has been thoroughly researched.

## Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula

* Investment philosophy published in the 2006 bestseller 'The little book that beats the market'. Investment approach centered around identifyong 'wonderfil stocks' at 'bargain price'

* 'Wonderful stock' quantified by the metric Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which measures bang-for-buck on actual capital employed. Excludes excess cash and interest-bearing assets to focus only on assets actually used in the business to generate the return.

* 'Bargain Price' is quantified by Earning Yield which is the ratio of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to Enterprice Value (Like P/E ratio but capital structure independent). 

* Invest in the top 20-30 companies (excluding finance and Insurance companies), accumulating 2-3 positions per month over a 12-month period. Re-balance the portfolio once a year.

## Piotroski F-Score

* Piotroski F-Score is a number between 0-9 which is used to assess strength of company's financial position (9 being the best). Developed by Stanford Accounting Professor Joseph Piotroski.

* Scores are assigned for various parameters based on the below criteria.

1. Profitability Criteria:
  - Positive return on assets in the current year (1 point).   
  - Positive operating cash flow in the current year (1 point).   
  - Return on assets higher in current year compared to previous year (1 point).   

2. Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds Criteria:
  - Lower ratio of long term debt in the current period, compared to the previous year (decreased leverage) (1 point).   
  - Higher current ratio this year compared to the previous year (more liquidity) (1 point).   
  - No new shares were issued in the last year (lack of dilution) (1 point).

3. Operating Efficiency Criteria: 
  - A higher gross margin compared to the previous year (1 point).
  - A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previoud year (1 point).

* Pick stocks with score 8-9 and rebalance every 6 months or 1 year. Best results ovserved in mid cap and small cap stocks.
