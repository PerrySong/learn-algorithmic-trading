Take note
1.) 50 ema above price is a downtrend
2.) 50 ema below price is an uptrend
3.) 50 ema going through price is sideways price movement
4.) price break through 50 ema possible trend change
5.) ema can act as price support or resistance
6.) ema can be use for trend trading and reversal trading
7.) down trend line is always drawn on top of price connecting resistance points of price
8.) up trend line is always drawn below of price connecting support points of price
9.) drawing horizontal support or resistance line will connect multiple support and resistance point, look for horizontal resistance turned support line or horizontal support turn resistance line, either one will appear when look for closest to the current price market

Trend trading
1.) on daily timeframe identify and draw horizontal resistance turned support line and immediate trendline
2.) after price breaks immediate  trendline on daily timeframe start to look for a reversal trade
3.) the price break on the immediate trendline is the area of confluence where the immediate trendline, support or resistance line and 50 ema line should all intersect line up in the area of confluence
4.) check price area of confluence is lined up on both the daily timeframe and 4 hour timeframe
5.) enter the trade at the area of  confluence back at the daily timeframe for the immediate trendline

Reversal trading
1.) on daily timeframe identify and draw horizontal resistance turned support line and immediate trendline
2.) sometimes after price intersect just two lines the 50ema and the immediate trendline, a new immediate trendline appears on the price during price reversal
3.) if there is a new immediate trendline in this case, the previous immediate trendline is now called the long term trend line, and the new immediate trendline is called the short term trend line
4.) now having a short term trend line, check price area of confluence is lined up on both the daily timeframe and 4 hour timeframe for the short term trend line
5.) enter the trade at the area of  confluence back at the daily timeframe for the short term trendline

Intraday trading
1.) on daily timeframe identify and draw horizontal support turn resistance line and immediate longterm trendline
2.) once price break immediate long term trend line i look for a reaction of key support
3.) I go to 4 hour time frame and wait for a reaction of key support
4.) when price reaches key support i check price area of confluence is lined up at key support together with short term trend line, 50ema, and backside of the long term trend line
5.) after price action at the area of confluence all lined up i draw a shorter term trend line at the pullback to confirm the shorter term trend line pullback is over
6.) i look for a long entry and enter a long trade
